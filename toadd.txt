Set the filenames correctly
Set folder structure accordingly
Set the paths to folders need to be in 1.4. "Import the the metadata"



What happens
This generates a savefile .npz (for wine dataset 806MB)
and a segmentation result .csv file (for wine dataset 1.5MB)

Note
Currently you can only run this once with the same savefilename (without renaming or deleting the results) as the the segmentation results get added to the csv segmentation result .csv file  





Edits needed: 

the classes selections need to be optimised for other datasets
plotting colors and markers based on sample classes
no universal sample import scheme
full data TSNE has a bug
